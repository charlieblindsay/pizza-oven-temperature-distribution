# Pizza Oven Temperature Distribution

Overview:
- **Physics modelled**: Temperature variation in space and time of a cylindrical pizza oven
- **Partial differential equation used**: Heat diffusion equation in cylindrical polar coordinates
- **Numerical method used**: Finite difference explicit method; the heat diffusion equation was discretized in space and time.

## Results
These graphs show the temperature as a function of:
- Height above base of oven (y-axis)
- Radial distance from centre of oven (x-axis)

Each graph is at a different snapshot in time since the initial conditions.
For comparison, there are graphs for an empty oven and an oven with a cake inside.
