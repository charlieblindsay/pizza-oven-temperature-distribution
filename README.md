Overview:
- Physics modelled: Temperature variation in space and time of a cylindrical pizza oven
- Partial differential equation used: Heat diffusion equation in cylindrical polar coordinates
- Numerical method used: Finite difference explicit method; the heat diffusion equation was discretized in space and time
